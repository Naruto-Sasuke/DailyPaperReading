# PaperReading
It mainly contains most papers that I have read.
For ease of writing, I just write them down orderlessly.

## Minor-First Rule
The more specific field it is included, the high priority it belongs to.
For example, some papers propose methods to generate cartoons using GANs.
Then they will be categoried into `style transfer`

# Maybe I will do
Maybe later, I can add some short descriptions about each paper
to make it easier for myself or someone else to catch something useful.
But I think if anyone can help me... Or maybe I just think too much.
