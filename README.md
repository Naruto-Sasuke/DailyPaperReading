# PaperReading
It mainly contains most papers that I have read.
For ease of writing, I just write them down orderlessly.

## Minor-First Rule
The more specific field it included, the high priority it belongs to.
For example, some paper give a method to generative cartoons using GAN.
Then it will be classified into `style transfer`

# Maybe I will do
Maybe later, I can add some short descriptions about each paper
to make it easier for myself or someone else to catch something useful.
